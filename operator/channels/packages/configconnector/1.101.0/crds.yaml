                  * VPC_PEERING for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.

                  * IPSEC_INTERCONNECT for addresses created from a private IP range
                    that are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an IPsec-encrypted Cloud
                    Interconnect configuration. These addresses are regional resources.

                  * PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT for a private network address that is used
                  to configure Private Service Connect. Only global internal addresses
                  can use this purpose.
